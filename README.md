# ENIAC Discount Tactics Review — A Data Science Narrative
This Document Presents An Overview Of The Second Collaborative Project Completed In The Data Science & Ai Course At Wbs Coding School.

# Summary :fa-barcode: :fa-barcode:
This Project Involved Something Beyond Python Scripts And Seaborn Plots − Rather, It Was About Coming To Grips With A Story That Was Hidden In A Messy Set Of Real-World Data.

We Started With Four Separate Csv Files Of Information On Orders, Products, Brands, And Transaction Data Collected During Eniac’S 437-Day Operational Timeframe. This Data Was Messy In All Of Its Glory, As It Contained Inconsistent Types And Formats, Repetitions, Missing Values, And Mismatched Records That Conveyed All The Complication That Can Accompany A Business’ Data Systems.

From There, We Painstakingly Cleaned And Explored The Data To Find Evidence Of Customer Patterns, Seasonal Patterns, And An Understanding Of The Correlation Between Discounts And Revenue Generation.

We Found Evidence That Eniac Was Already Doing Well Using Discounts - €7.82m In Revenue Supported By €1.39m Invested In Its Strategy Of Using Discounts - But Still Had An Opportunity To Improve Performance.

Our Recommendation: Eniac Should Think About Using The Following Three-Legged Stool Strategy-In The Form Of The Sweet Spot Of 11-20% Discount Levels During Major Holiday Periods, With Keeping The Brand Premium Strategies Intact.
